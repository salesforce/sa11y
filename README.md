# Salesforce Accessibility Automation Libraries

Automated Accessibility Testing Libraries and Tools ([@sa11y packages](https://www.npmjs.com/org/sa11y)) based on [axe-core][axe] providing support for [Jest](#jest-integration) unit tests, [WebdriverIO](#wdio-integration) component/integration tests used by teams in Salesforce. However, they are not specific to Salesforce and can be used to test any UI [supported by axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core#supported-browsers) for accessibility. These libraries are designed to be flexible, customizable and reusable to support automated accessibility testing in different testing workflows from unit to integration tests.

## Packages

This repo contains the following packages for automated accessibility testing:

### [Jest integration](./packages/jest/README.md)

[![published npm version of @sa11y/jest](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@sa11y/jest)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sa11y/jest)
![node-current (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/node/v/@sa11y/jest)

-   Provides a `toBeAccessible()` accessibility matcher for Jest
    -   integrates the [assertAccessible API](./packages/assert/README.md) with the [Jest assertion API](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/using-matchers)
-   Provides an option to set up the sa11y API to be invoked automatically at the end of each test
-   To add accessibility testing to your Jest tests use this package

### [WDIO integration](./packages/wdio/README.md)

[![published npm version of @sa11y/wdio](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@sa11y/wdio)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sa11y/wdio)
![node-current (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/node/v/@sa11y/wdio)

-   Provides `assertAccessible()`, `assertAccessibleSync()` APIs that can be used with [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/) to check accessibility of web pages rendered in browsers

![Screenshot showing a11y errors from a test using Sa11y WDIO in a terminal](https://github.com/salesforce/sa11y/blob/media/screenshot/wdio.png?raw=true)

### [assertAccessible API](./packages/assert/README.md)

[![published npm version of @sa11y/assert](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@sa11y/assert)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sa11y/assert)
![node-current (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/node/v/@sa11y/assert)

-   Checks DOM or HTML Element for accessibility issues and throws an error if a11y issues are found
-   To add accessibility testing to your Javascript unit tests _not_ using Jest, use this package

### [a11y results formatter](./packages/format/README.md)

[![published npm version of @sa11y/format](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@sa11y/format)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sa11y/format)
![node-current (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/node/v/@sa11y/format)

-   Formats raw JSON output of a11y issues from [axe] into an easy to consume format by consolidating and cross-referencing
-   Used by assert Accessible API and Jest a11y matcher
-   To use axe directly and want to format the results from `axe.run` use this package
-   A new formatter `groupViolationResultsProcessor` also made available to group the a11y violations per jest test case as the existing formatter would generate test failures for each violation

### [Preset accessibility rules](./packages/preset-rules/README.md)

[![published npm version of @sa11y/preset-rules](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@sa11y/preset-rules)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sa11y/preset-rules)
![node-current (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/node/v/@sa11y/preset-rules)

-   Provides Base, Extended, Full accessibility preset rules as [axe] configuration
-   The Base preset rule is used by default in the Jest a11y matcher and assert Accessible APIs
    -   The APIs can be overridden to use the Extended or Full ruleset as necessary

### [Minified bundle for testing in browser](./packages/browser-lib/README.md)

[![published npm version of @sa11y/browser-lib](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@sa11y/browser-lib)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sa11y/browser-lib)
![node-current (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/node/v/@sa11y/browser-lib)

-   Provides a minified version of selected `@sa11y` libraries to be injected into a browser (using webdriver) and executed from integration testing workflows.
-   Gives WCAG SC for rulesets in addition with [axe] tags

### Internal packages

-   Private package providing test utilities for `@sa11y` packages

#### [Integration Tests](./packages/test-integration/README.md)
